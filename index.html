    <h2>The Legend & Legacy of the Nine-Eyed Dzi</h2>
    <p>From the misty highlands of Tibet comes a relic steeped in mystery ‚Äî the Nine-Eyed Dzi. Some say it was a divine gift that fell from the heavens; others whisper it was crafted by the Serpent Kings, rulers of ancient subterranean realms.
    Nine eyes, each a portal of fortune, power, and spiritual clarity. Worn by kings, monks, and warriors alike, this bead was not just an ornament ‚Äî it was a shield against misfortune and a magnet for prosperity. For centuries, it passed silently between the hands of the chosen few.</p>

<!-- Symbolism -->
<section id="symbolism">
    <h2>Symbolism & Power</h2>
    <p>The nine eyes represent the supreme alignment of blessings: compassion, glory, protection, health, wealth, longevity, success, wisdom, and the clearing of karmic obstacles.
    It is believed that a Nine-Eyed Dzi does not just accompany its owner ‚Äî it works for them. In Tibetan lore, each eye awakens over time, amplifying the bead‚Äôs spiritual energy and forging an unbreakable connection between relic and keeper.</p>

<!-- Why Few Know -->
<section id="fewknow">
    <h2>Why So Few People Know About Dzi Beads</h2>
    <p>Unlike diamonds or gold, the Dzi was never meant for the masses. It is a secret known to Himalayan highlanders and a handful of collectors, mystics, and monks.
    In modern times, a few lucky souls ‚Äî including certain celebrities ‚Äî wear them quietly, never advertising their ownership, simply enjoying the silent influence of the bead. This silence is part of the mystery‚Ä¶ and part of its power.</p>

    <h2>Modern Stories ‚Äî The Nagoya Survivor‚Äôs Bead</h2>
    <p>In the 1990s, a China Airlines jet tragically crashed in Nagoya, Japan. Amid the devastation, one passenger emerged almost unharmed ‚Äî wearing a single Dzi bead. To this day, collectors speak of the ‚ÄúNagoya Survivor‚Äôs Bead‚Äù as living proof of the relic‚Äôs mystical protection.</p>
